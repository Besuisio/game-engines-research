# Game engine Research
For my game engine research, a protype will be made in every game engine on the research list.

### *list of game enginges:*
- Godot
- Unity
- Unreal

### For every prototype I will test the dev experience by building the following:

1. A movable character
    1. Should be able to collide with props
1. A small playable world and one interior
    1. player can enter a buildings
1. A quick mission to complete (level)
    1. interact with an npc by pressing on a button
    1. npc says hello

### Every prototype has to keep the following criteria in mind:

- It has to a 2d game
- It support webGL (webbrowser engines)
- It has a nice and simple IDE
- (Optional) it can also be integrated to a mobile web version or mobile game
