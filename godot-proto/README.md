# klm-godot-proto

For the game engine research, a protype will be made in every game engine on the research list.

For every prototype I will test the dev experience by building the following:

1. A movable character
1. A small playable world
1. A quick mission to complete (level)

Every prototype has to keep the following criteria in mind:

- It has to a 2d game
- It support webGL (webbrowser engines)
- It has a nice and simple IDE
- (Optional) it can also be integrated to a mobile web version or mobile game
